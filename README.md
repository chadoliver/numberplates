# numberplates

This is a quick'n'dirty server that I wrote to scrape a particular sort of data from ```http://carjam.co.nz```. You can think of
it as a wrapper around the website.

### How to Use This Code

1. Download the code: ```git clone https://github.com/chadoliver/numberplates.git```
2. Navigate into the repository: ```cd numberplates```
3. Install the required dependencies: ```npm install```
4. Start the server: ```node server.js```
5. Scrape data by navigating to a URL corresponding to the numberplate: ```http://0.0.0.0/dem01```
